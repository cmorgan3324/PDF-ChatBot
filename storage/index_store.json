Digitalization may hold the key to alleviate congestion and its adverse effects on the stakeholders involved. In this study, several tools and technologies that can improve export cargo flows were explored. A comprehensive qualitative multimethod approach was employed, comprising an comprehensive literature review and nine stakeholder interviews. Interviews   served   to   investigate   the   contemporary   landscape   of   digitalization   and   elicit stakeholders'  perspectives,  experiences,  and  insights  pertaining  to  the  digitalization  of  export processes  at  SPL. Parallels were  drawn  between  landside  operations  in  airports  and  maritime ports to validate technologies. The research exposed the following major findings: • Transparent business rules need to be agreed upon between stakeholders; • Dynamic scheduling and slot management will provide details on available dock capacity at GHs; • Horizontal  collaboration  can  be  expanded  to  optimize  truck  load  factors  and  reduce movements; • Traffic  monitoring  technology  can  help  trucking  companies  to  better  understand  real- time traffic information at SPL landside.

Introduction Air cargo is vital for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (SPL). While air cargo only constitutes 3 percent of  all  flight  movements  at  the  airport,  it  is  responsible  for  25%  of  all  jobs  at  the  airport  and, therefore, a significant financial contributor to the airport's ecosystem (de Haan & Streng, 2020). Smooth   air   cargo   operations   are   thus   paramount   for   the   airport's   attractiveness   and competitiveness.

Introduction Air cargo is vital for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (SPL). While air cargo only constitutes 3 percent of  all  flight  movements  at  the  airport,  it  is  responsible  for  25%  of  all  jobs  at  the  airport  and, therefore, a significant financial contributor to the airport's ecosystem (de Haan & Streng, 2020). Smooth   air   cargo   operations   are   thus   paramount   for   the   airport's   attractiveness   and competitiveness. Even more since air cargo is generally considered time-sensitive or shipments are  booked  on  flights  with  low  frequencies. One part  of  the  operation  in  particular  deserves attention;  landside  cargo  operations. Landside  cargo  operations  involves   the  transportation  of freight from a  second  line  logistics  service  provider,  a  freight  forwarder  (FFW),  and  a  first  line logistics service provider ground handling agent (GH) (Romero-Silva & Mujica Mota, 2022). GH offers logistics services for one or several airlines that operate to and from the airport. SPL has five different GH companies that between them operate from nine distinct warehouses. Figure 1 illustrates the highly diversified positioning of only a selection of stakeholders. Many more FFWs are located in close proximity to the airport, but outside the satellite image.  Figure 1   Satellite view of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol cargo operators ( Open source: Bing Maps)  In this environment, the SPL air cargo community continuously faces significant landside supply/ demand imbalances as unchoreographed trucks report to the GH warehouses for either delivery or  pickup  of  freight. This  leads  to  congestion  and  subsequent delays  exceeding  multiple  hours, especially   during   peak   periods   like   cargo   peak   season   and   Fridays   (Vrancken,   2020). Coordinating  landside  operations  among  airlines,  GHs,  and  FFWs  proves  challenging  due  to Legend: GH (all) FFW (selection) Trucking company   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 various  factors  such  as  multiple  agents  involved,  unpredictable  shipment  arrivals,  and  varying volumes of shipments (Bombelli & Fazi, 2022). Furthermore, in the accountability structure, the airlines are the client of the GHs while in practice the FFW must coordinate activities with the GH, which impairs the communication between GH and FFW. This in turn hurts the transparency and  predictability  of  shipment  availability  at  the  handler,  complicating  the  FFW's  planning process (Verduijn et al., 2019). SPL exemplifies this complexity with five GHs managing landside freight from around 150 FFWs, further complicated by constrained loading dock resources and personnel  (Romero-Silva  &  Mujica  Mota,  2022). Several  studies  have  proposed  theoretical models   for   landside   optimization   with   a   focus   on   horizontal   collaboration. Horizontal collaboration involves companies that operate at the same level of the value chain, but usually in different chains. They collaborate by sharing capacity, planning, handling services and possibly even booking services. This kind of collaboration takes place among shippers who produce goods and FFWs  or transportation  companies  who  arrange  the  transport  of  goods  for  shippers (Verdonck  et  al.,  2013). Sharing  of  information  between  such  companies  is  paramount  for horizontal  collaboration  to  be  attainable. An  overview  of  available  digital  technologies  that  can improve the congestion issues as described above lacks in the existing literature.  Hence, this research aims to explore how digitalization can improve air cargo export flows in an effort to reduce congestion and its adverse effects, as encapsulated by the main question: \"How can digitalization improve export cargo flows at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol?\".  Like  airports,  efficient  maritime  ports  rely  on  cooperation  and  coordination  between  privately owned businesses and government agencies, such as customs and other authorities (Inkinen et al., 2019). The port industry is also highly network-centric with a plethora of independent actors engaged in a port-to-port or door-to-door voyage (Raza et al., 2023). Stakeholders show a strong resemblance,   with   shipping   companies   for   airlines,   port   authorities/operators   for   airport operators, and terminal  operators  for  ground  handlers,  while  freight  forwarders  and  trucking companies  assume  the  same  role. Landside  congestion  is  commonly  cited  as  one  of  the  biggest challenges in effective port operations (Gurumurthy & Bharthur, 2019; Inkinen et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). Therefore, frequent parallels between these two modalities will be drawn. The  structure  of  this  research  is  as  follows. A  comprehensive  literature  review  covers  relevant definitions  and  previous  research,  spanning  air  cargo  operations  at  SPL,  global  contexts,  and digitalization in maritime ports. This review culminates in an analysis of the current state-of-the- art application of digitalization within air cargo. Following the literature review, the methodology employed  in  the  study  is  explained,  detailing  the  research  design,  data  collection  methods, sampling, and analytical approaches used. Subsequently, the findings chapter presents empirical outcomes from the stakeholder interviews. A meticulous analysis of the available digital tools and their  impact  on  SPL's  landside  operations  is  presented,  offering  a  comprehensive  overview  of   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 tangible research findings. The concluding chapter integrates insights from the literature review and interview findings. This chapter underscores the study's contributions and outlines practical implications, while also suggesting potential avenues for future research.

Landside  congestion  is  commonly  cited  as  one  of  the  biggest challenges in effective port operations (Gurumurthy & Bharthur, 2019; Inkinen et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). Therefore, frequent parallels between these two modalities will be drawn. The  structure  of  this  research  is  as  follows. A  comprehensive  literature  review  covers  relevant definitions  and  previous  research,  spanning  air  cargo  operations  at  SPL,  global  contexts,  and digitalization in maritime ports. This review culminates in an analysis of the current state-of-the- art application of digitalization within air cargo. Following the literature review, the methodology employed  in  the  study  is  explained,  detailing  the  research  design,  data  collection  methods, sampling, and analytical approaches used. Subsequently, the findings chapter presents empirical outcomes from the stakeholder interviews. A meticulous analysis of the available digital tools and their  impact  on  SPL's  landside  operations  is  presented,  offering  a  comprehensive  overview  of   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 tangible research findings.

Literature review Optimizing the export cargo flow at SPL centers around a problem that is also known as a pickup and delivery problem (PDP). As Savelsbergh and Sol (1995) proposed, a general PDP has a set of routes  that  must  be  constructed  to  satiate  transportation  requests. There  is  a  fleet  of  vehicles assigned to operate the routes. Each vehicle has a specific capacity, a designated starting point, and  a  final  destination. The  starting  point  being  the  FFW  while  the  end  point  is  the  GH.  Alternatively, Additional complexity arises from to the limited number of loading docks available for unloading trucks at the GH. These docks are capacity-constrained resources (Romero-Silva & Mujica  Mota,  2022). Regarding  operating  capacity,   Klein  (1960)  states  that  firms  have  a theoretical  capacity  which  is  defined  as  the  output  when  operating  at  maximum  capacity. In reality, this is not achievable since there will always be factors negatively influencing capacity such as  technical  or  staff  issues. At  SPL,  yet  an  additional  factor  is  at  play. GHs  facilitate  logistical services for its customer airlines who in turn offer freight capacity to their customers, the FFWs. This  means  that  the  GH  is  not  able  to  directly  adjust  its  capacity  based  on  customer  demand.  According to a project by TKI Dinalog  (2022),  containing  several  research  studies,  GHs  at  SPL receive  truck  deliveries  every  day  of  the  week,  but  they  are  not  evenly  distributed. As  a  result, there  is  congestion  during  peak  hours. While  many  shipments  are  delivered  just  in  time,  the report found that around 25% of arriving trucks contain at least one shipment that arrives more than 24 hours before it was required.  A parallel can be drawn between solving the landside delivery problem and research by Verdonck et  al. (2013),  who  focused  on  horizontal  collaborative  logistics  from  the  perspective  of  road transportation companies. As explained by Verdonck et  al. (2013), horizontal collaboration can be  distinctly  split  into  two  operation  approaches:  order  sharing  and  capacity  sharing. Order sharing encompasses the combining, sharing, or exchanging data on customer requests while the truck fleet of cooperation participants is left unchanged. Increased capacity utilization of trucks is cited as the main improvement of order sharing. Conversely, parties may cooperate horizontally by  sharing  vehicle  capacities  rather  than  sharing  customer  requests. In  cases  where  alliance partners cannot share private order information, capacity sharing can be a viable alternative to order sharing. 2.1 Definitions The  wide-scale  incremental  innovation  and  adoption  of  technology  is  commonly  referred  to  as industrial revolutions. Scholars agree upon innovations around the microprocessor at around the 1990's as the big bang of the ICT revolution, marking the start of the third industrial revolution (Taalbi,  2019). Anno  2023,  the  world  has  entered  the  fourth  industrial  revolution,  which according to Heikkilä et al. (2022) means the \"intelligent networking of machines and processes   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 for  industry  with  the  help  of  information  and  communication  technology\". While  airports currently  have  implemented  some  industry  2.0  technologies,  industry  4.0  will  allow  for  fully connected   airport   stakeholder   with   superior   proactive/reactive   adaptation   to   real-time operational needs (Kern, 2021). This increase in levels of technological innovation in nearly every business, workplace, and pocket is a process that is known as \"digitalization\" (Muro et al., 2017). According  to  Gobble  (2018),  digitalization  refers  to  the  use  of  digital  technology  to  create  and harvest   value   in   new   ways. On   a   similar   note,   Teubner   and   Stockhinger   (2020)   define digitalization as the interplay between digital technologies and social and institutional processes. Continuing that these technologies shape society and economy. Following that definition, Gartner (2023)  adds  that  the  outcomes  from  digitalization  can  be  categorized  two-fold. First,  digital optimization   outcomes   that   improve   existing   operations   and   processes. Second,   digital transformation  outcomes  reinvent  the  market  that  is  served  with  new  products,  services,  or business models. Digitalization outcomes are rarely purely optimization or transformation, since most  successful  strategies  include  an  optimum  mix  of  both  initiatives  (Gartner,  2023). Despite this fact, this research focuses on the first outcome as it seeks to find optimization of the current processes  while  acknowledging  business  transformation  initiatives. While  digitalization  can  be seen as an end goal, it is merely a tool to improve businesses and logistics management.  Heikkilä et al. (2022) categorized digital technologies for the application in smart ports into four groups:  process  technologies,  for  instance  robotics;  physical/digital  interface  technologies,  like the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  and  dashboards;  network  technologies,  such  as  cloud  computing, blockchain,   real-time   data   sharing,   and   data-processing   technologies   boasting   predictive analytics  and  decision-making,  such  as  big  data,  machine  learning  and  simulation. From  these four  categories,  process  technologies  will  be  left  out  of  scope  since  robotics  and  automated vehicles are mostly applicable inside warehouses or on private premises and will

  a   similar   note,   Teubner   and   Stockhinger   (2020)   define digitalization as the interplay between digital technologies and social and institutional processes. Continuing that these technologies shape society and economy. Following that definition, Gartner (2023)  adds  that  the  outcomes  from  digitalization  can  be  categorized  two-fold. First,  digital optimization   outcomes   that   improve   existing   operations   and   processes. Second,   digital transformation  outcomes  reinvent  the  market  that  is  served  with  new  products,  services,  or business models. Digitalization outcomes are rarely purely optimization or transformation, since most  successful  strategies  include  an  optimum  mix  of  both  initiatives  (Gartner,  2023). Despite this fact, this research focuses on the first outcome as it seeks to find optimization of the current processes  while  acknowledging  business  transformation  initiatives. While  digitalization  can  be seen as an end goal, it is merely a tool to improve businesses and logistics management.  Heikkilä et al. (2022) categorized digital technologies for the application in smart ports into four groups:  process  technologies,  for  instance  robotics;  physical/digital  interface  technologies,  like the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  and  dashboards;  network  technologies,  such  as  cloud  computing, blockchain,   real-time   data   sharing,   and   data-processing   technologies   boasting   predictive analytics  and  decision-making,  such  as  big  data,  machine  learning  and  simulation. From  these four  categories,  process  technologies  will  be  left  out  of  scope  since  robotics  and  automated vehicles are mostly applicable inside warehouses or on private premises and will not be seen on public roads (that make up the landside area) for at least 15 years (Frisoni et al., 2016). Predictability  is  defined  as  \"the  quality  something  has  when  it  is  possible  for  you  to  know  in advance that it will happen\" (Oxford University Press, n.d.). In the context of air cargo deliveries at GH facilities, it means the act of knowing what, why, when, where, who, and how freight will be  delivered  (SCMP,  2022). This  means  knowing  details  about  the  shipment's  content  and quantity,  for  which  flight  it  is  booked  (why),  when  it  will  arrive,  where  (potentially  a  specific warehouse/location/dock), which driver, and which trailer/license plate will bring the shipments.  Jandrić and Ranđelović (2018) explored how digitalization is transforming the world of workers. As  companies  adopt  digital  technologies,  such  as  computers  and  other  IT  tools,  the  nature  of people's  work  undergoes  a  transformation. Moreover,  Zaharia  and  Pietreanu's  (2018)  work emphasizes how a digital culture will promote transparency, improve stakeholder collaboration, encourage   decision-making,   and   stimulate   risk-taking. In   turn,   this   digital   culture   will   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 significantly   impact   the   airport's   operations. Gallardo   underpins   this,   noting   that   the implementation  of  a  port  community  system  is  not  merely  an  IT  project,  but  a  change management project (The World Bank, 2020). 2.2 Digitalization areas As mentioned in section 2.1, digitalization can be clustered into three distinct categories: interface technologies, network technologies, and data-processing technologies.  2.2.1 Interface technology Physical/digital  interface  technology,  as  defined  by  Culot  et  al. (2020),  entails  \"bridging  the cyber-space  with  the  reality  of  machines,  products  and  people  at  work  (i.e.,  the  IoT,  cyber- physical systems, and visualization technologies)\" (Culot et al., 2020, p. 8). Several researchers have suggested IoT as a tool to aid in logistical challenges (Egorov et al., 2020; Kern, 2021; Parola et  al.,  2020). The field of IoT involves combining information processing, communication, and control across a range of transportation systems. This includes vehicles, infrastructure, and the people who use them. It emphasizes the importance of these different aspects working together seamlessly (Nguyen et al., 2023).  IoT  technology  could  have  a  strong  use  case  in  for  example  traffic  monitoring. By  using  IoT sensors  and  cameras,  traffic  patterns  such  as  vehicle  speed  and  the  volume  of  vehicles  on  the landside area of SPL can be monitored and recorded. This information can then provide real-time information  on  congestion  levels  at  the  different  port  facilities  and  allows  trucking  companies enabling  to  make  more  informed  decisions  on  where  to  go. As  a  result,  businesses  can  gain valuable  real-time  insights  from  their  connected  devices  (Nguyen  et  al.,  2023). Several  ports, including Mombasa and Montreal have employed the use of IoT to reduce congestions. Moreover, in the ports of Rotterdam and Hamburg, real-time information exchange and IoT-enabled sensors are  providing  valuable  insights,  allowing  stakeholders  to  leverage  that  data  to  gain  insight  into information flow, traffic flow, and cargo flow (Brunila et al., 2021).  2.2.2 Network technology Gartner (2023) describes several trends of which three can be classified as network technologies. Specifically: data sharing and collaboration, real-time data tracking, and blockchain are proposed for application in (air) port landside optimization by numerous academics (Allied Aviation, 2023; Kuteyi and Winkler, 2022; Parola et al., 2020; Inkinen, 2019; Egorov et al., 2020). Collaborating with competitors to gain a collaborative competitive edge is a practice known as co- opetition  (Brandenburger  &  Nalebuff,  2020). It  requires  a  long-term  view  and  necessitates  a platform to cooperate. Facilitating such platforms for communication at airports is done through   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 Cargo Community Systems (CCS), also called Airport Community Systems (UNECE, n.d.). Such systems are neutral and open electronic platforms that facilitate information exchange between public  and  private  stakeholders  at  the  airport,  in  order  to  improve  the  competitive  position  of airport  communities. The  level  of  collaboration  intensity  and  depth  is  closely  tied  to  the operational interlinkage in data management. Responsible coordination can be organized around port  communities,  which  would  require  a  shift  from  providing  only  physical  infrastructure  for material transportation to digitalized management of logistics data that can be shared as needed (Inkinen,   2019). An   important   consideration   of   co-opetition   is   the   emotional   aspect (Brandenburger  &  Nalebuff,  2020).

(2023) describes several trends of which three can be classified as network technologies. Specifically: data sharing and collaboration, real-time data tracking, and blockchain are proposed for application in (air) port landside optimization by numerous academics (Allied Aviation, 2023; Kuteyi and Winkler, 2022; Parola et al., 2020; Inkinen, 2019; Egorov et al., 2020). Collaborating with competitors to gain a collaborative competitive edge is a practice known as co- opetition  (Brandenburger  &  Nalebuff,  2020). It  requires  a  long-term  view  and  necessitates  a platform to cooperate. Facilitating such platforms for communication at airports is done through   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 Cargo Community Systems (CCS), also called Airport Community Systems (UNECE, n.d.). Such systems are neutral and open electronic platforms that facilitate information exchange between public  and  private  stakeholders  at  the  airport,  in  order  to  improve  the  competitive  position  of airport  communities. The  level  of  collaboration  intensity  and  depth  is  closely  tied  to  the operational interlinkage in data management. Responsible coordination can be organized around port  communities,  which  would  require  a  shift  from  providing  only  physical  infrastructure  for material transportation to digitalized management of logistics data that can be shared as needed (Inkinen,   2019). An   important   consideration   of   co-opetition   is   the   emotional   aspect (Brandenburger  &  Nalebuff,  2020). There  are  stakeholders  who  accept  a  situation  of  multiple winners,  while  others  do  not  feel  the  same  way. Zaheer  and  Trkman  (2017)  have  shown  that  a greater  willingness  to  share  information  within  a  supply  chain  leads  to  improved  quality  of information  sharing  with  partners  in  the  supply  chain. Factors  within  an  organization,  such  as trust,  reciprocity,  commitment,  and  IT  infrastructure,  can  have  a  positive  impact  on  the willingness  to  share  information. This,  in  turn,  can  lead  to  an  improvement  in  the  quality  of information sharing (Zaheer & Trkman, 2017).  Blockchain is a decentralized and transparent digital ledger that records and verifies transactions. It  enhances  collaboration  by  enabling  multiple  stakeholders  to  share  and  access  real-time information  securely. This  fosters  trust,  reduces  disputes,  and  enhances  accountability  as  each step in the supply chain is securely recorded (Poleshkina, 2021). The innate nature of blockchain ensures data integrity, facilitating smoother and more efficient cross-organizational cooperation. Ionides et al. (2019) suggest that blockchain may prove beneficial for air cargo. This is supported by a flowchart where preconditions such as lack of trust, complex and evolving requirements, and high  transaction  volumes  are  considered. All  these  conditions  apply  to  the  high-complexity environment of air cargo. 2.2.3 Data-processing technology New  opportunities  arise  with  the  influx  of  (new)  available  data  from  data-sharing. Data  is meaningless without the right context. In context, though, it offers three purposes (Wang & Yan, 2023). Firstly,  through descriptive  analysis,  data  serves  as  input  to  reflect  on  what  happened.  Second,   it   can   be   used   to   monitor   operations   in real-time   (facilitated   through   network technology). Lastly,  it  can  be  used  to  make  estimations  for  the  future  in  the  form  of  predictive analytics  (Wang  &  Yan,  2023). Prescriptive  analytics  is  a  technique  that  combines  descriptive analytics,  predictive  analytics,  and  operations  research  to  suggest  the  best  possible  decision  to maximize  business  value. The  key  to  prescriptive  analytics  is  identifying  potential  outcomes  or decisions using accurate predictions that incorporate artificial intelligence, operations research, and  expert  systems  (Wang  &  Yan,  2023). Artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning  are important tools to aid in these complex processes.

Many freight forwarders have their own trucks to pick up and deliver shipments. In the current situation at SPL, three methods for freight delivery exist: dedicated   trucking,   consolidation   by   carriers   and   consolidation   by   handlers   and   freight forwarders  (Verduijn  et  al.,  2019). Applying  horizontal  collaboration  at  SPL  was  proposed  by Ankersmit  et  al. (2014). Following  Ankersmit  et  al.'s    (2014)   research  the  Milkrun-project  was initiated. Van Alebeek and Bombelli (2021), proposed a fully integrated five-phase auction-based competition  model,  a  form  of  order  sharing  where  competition  is  preserved. They  use  a combinatorial  auction  system  to  exchange  transportation  requests  without  disclosing  sensitive company  information. FFWs  submit  their  requests  into  a  pool,  which  are  then  organized  into bundles by a central planner and put up for auction. Then, the optimal routing strategy for the fleet is calculated by a central planner who has access to all the collaborating FFWs and transport requests. The model incorporates the GH dock capacity and thereby helps relieve truck congestion similar  to  slot  management  technology. A  clear  improvement  in  freight  forwarder  profitability was  found  while  simultaneously  decreasing  congestion  at  the  ground  handlers. Additionally,  a reduction in the total distance traveled was detailed, resulting in favorable environmental effects. Limited collaboration disadvantages were found when applying this model. Further research by Bombelli  and  Fazi  (2022)  took  a  slightly  different  approach,  demonstrating  a  cooperative framework for the most optimal delivery of unit load devices (ULDs) from FFWs to GHs based on capacity sharing. They emphasized the role of an independent IT company to facilitate the central planning of landside logistics, in combination with the auction system described before. Similar to Bombelli and Fazi (2022), and Van Agerbeek and Bombelli (2021), Romero-Silva and Mujica Mota  (2022)  further  analyzed  capacity  sharing  but  found  contradictory  results. Their  analysis suggests that the efficiency increase and cost reduction are much less significant than previously found.

by a central planner and put up for auction. Then, the optimal routing strategy for the fleet is calculated by a central planner who has access to all the collaborating FFWs and transport requests. The model incorporates the GH dock capacity and thereby helps relieve truck congestion similar  to  slot  management  technology. A  clear  improvement  in  freight  forwarder  profitability was  found  while  simultaneously  decreasing  congestion  at  the  ground  handlers. Additionally,  a reduction in the total distance traveled was detailed, resulting in favorable environmental effects. Limited collaboration disadvantages were found when applying this model. Further research by Bombelli  and  Fazi  (2022)  took  a  slightly  different  approach,  demonstrating  a  cooperative framework for the most optimal delivery of unit load devices (ULDs) from FFWs to GHs based on capacity sharing. They emphasized the role of an independent IT company to facilitate the central planning of landside logistics, in combination with the auction system described before. Similar to Bombelli and Fazi (2022), and Van Agerbeek and Bombelli (2021), Romero-Silva and Mujica Mota  (2022)  further  analyzed  capacity  sharing  but  found  contradictory  results. Their  analysis suggests that the efficiency increase and cost reduction are much less significant than previously found. Continuing,  \"Thus,  management  at  SPL  ... should  be  aware  that  operational  policies (cooperative   or   otherwise)   might   result   in   opposite   results   for   different   performance measurements  since  we  found  trade-offs  in  all  the  operational  policies  considered  in  our experimental design.\" ( Romero-Silva & Mujica Mota,  2022, p. 13). Several  tools  and  projects  are  currently  active  at  SPL  which  are  laid  out  in  the  following paragraphs.  2.3.1 Cargonaut Cargonaut is a local cargo information facilitator that designed and maintains SPL's CCS and its sub tools. One such tool is eCargo Receipt which optimizes the export delivery process. eLink is a module  of  eCargo  Receipt  and  provides  real  time  insight  in  the  shipment  status  as  well  as  the   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 shipment  compliancy  status  for  delivery  of  cargo  at  the  ground  handlers  (Cargonaut,  n.d.).  Douven's  (2013)  showed  that  while  stakeholders  were  positive  and  willing  to  adopt  eLink, resistance existed. Especially smaller freight forwarders are not often able to be involved in the development resulting in surprises after implementation adding to resistance. Costs are also cited not  to  commit  to  a  new  IT  application. Moreover,  according  to  many  freight  forwarders,  the greatest advantage is the overall overview and that ultimately more and better control of processes is  achieved. The  20-25%  reduction  in  lead  time  and  paper  savings  touted  by  air  cargo  branch organization Air Cargo Netherlands (ACN) is not proving to be a decisive factor for the industry. The savings in lead time therefore apply almost exclusively to the transporter, who does not have to  wait  in  line  for  as  long  and  can  continue  faster. The  freight  forwarders  do  not  yet  see  their interest  in  this. While  Cargonaut  has  been  a  player  in  the  local  air  cargo  community  for  over twenty  years,  its  systems  are  becoming  outdated  (Versleijen,  2023). In  2020  Royal  Schiphol Group  purchased  the  platform  to  build  \"Europe's  smartest  cargo  hub\". Three  years  later, Cargonaut 2.0's new Port Community System is still not live (Versleijen, 2023).  2.3.2 CDM@Airports CargoHub offers a Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) Trucking platform at SPL, that aims to provide transparent and predictable information on truck movements to GHs and airlines. It also provides  capacity  and  cargo  availability  details  to  trucking  companies  to  reduce  loading  and unloading times (Jeffrey, 2022). A study involving Emirates Airlines, Jan de Rijk, and CargoHub, is  trialing  Cargo  iQ's  new  road  feeder  services  messaging  standards,  which  aim  to  close  the communication gap between truck drivers, trucking company's head office, and airlines (Cargo iQ,  2022). A  planning  mechanism  like  Trucking  CDM  is  designed  to  minimize  lost  time  and  to optimize handling processes in a digital environment (Riege Software, 2020). This ecosystem is connected  via  a  Cross  Chain  Control  Centre,  the  digital  twin  of  Trucking  CDM  IT  platform (Douven & Lute, 2015). The digital twin of the Trucking CDM platform is a digital solution to a more transparent  and  honest  communication  so  that  every  party  can  make  clear  and  better decisions. Currently,   the   GH   is   responsible   for   coordinating   movements,   although   an independent  party  could  be  considered  to  appoint  for  coordinating. The  advantage  that  this external  party  could  bring  is  strengthening  the  general  trust  in  the  cooperation  (Douven  & Lute,2015).  2.3.3 SCMP Schiphol's  smart  cargo  mainport  program  (SCMP)  started  in  2016  with  the  aim  of  making Schiphol the pioneer in sustainable innovation and optimization of the air freight chain. The cargo community,  including  KLM,  ACN,  Cargonaut,  Schiphol  Cargo,  Dutch  customs  ,  and  several universities,  has  been  working  on  this  ambition  ever  since. Together,  the  participants  want position  SPL  as  a  united  air  cargo  community that  focusses  on  optimal  landside  logistics,   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 digitization  of  the  supply  chain  and  new  innovations  (Amsterdam  Logistics,  2020). The  SCMP program  is  working  towards  a  digital  green  lane  with  a  digital  slot  planning  tool  as  outcome (SCMP, 2022). As part of this, digital pre-announcement was introduced in 2021, assuring that the  ground  handler  knows  who  and  what  is  coming  to  its  vicinity  (ACN,  2020). For  this,  the trucking company links its truck details and desired unloading time to this via Cargonaut's    eLink.  Another element of SCMP is the Milkrun initiative at SPL, launched in 2015. Similar to how dairy companies used to operate, Milkrun centers around combining shipments of different FFWs into a single journey to a shared destination. Combining shipments from several forwarders into fewer trucks allows to reduce the number of truck movements while also increasing the load factor of these   trucks. To   ensure   efficient   routing   and   loading   for   multiple   companies,   extensive collaboration is necessary at both planning and operational levels. This type of operations stems from  applied  research  into  horizontal  collaboration  at  SPL  by  Ankersmit  et  al. (2014).

The  SCMP program  is  working  towards  a  digital  green  lane  with  a  digital  slot  planning  tool  as  outcome (SCMP, 2022). As part of this, digital pre-announcement was introduced in 2021, assuring that the  ground  handler  knows  who  and  what  is  coming  to  its  vicinity  (ACN,  2020). For  this,  the trucking company links its truck details and desired unloading time to this via Cargonaut's    eLink.  Another element of SCMP is the Milkrun initiative at SPL, launched in 2015. Similar to how dairy companies used to operate, Milkrun centers around combining shipments of different FFWs into a single journey to a shared destination. Combining shipments from several forwarders into fewer trucks allows to reduce the number of truck movements while also increasing the load factor of these   trucks. To   ensure   efficient   routing   and   loading   for   multiple   companies,   extensive collaboration is necessary at both planning and operational levels. This type of operations stems from  applied  research  into  horizontal  collaboration  at  SPL  by  Ankersmit  et  al. (2014). Their research  shows  that  besides increased  truck  efficiency  and  a  reduction  of  truck  movements, smaller forwarding companies gain more frequent transportation opportunities at similar costs. A big drawback of the system is an increase in average shipment throughput time for collaborating companies. Gangsterer  and  Hartl  (2017)  identified  three  streams  of  research  for  collaborative vehicle routing: centralized collaborative planning, decentralized planning without auctions, and auction-based  decentralized  planning. Milkrun  can  be  typified  as  a  decentralized  planning without auctions as the GH is responsible for orchestrating the most optimal truck loads. Initially, a  small  number  of  GHs  and  FFWs  participated  and  focused  only  at  import  shipments. At  the beginning of 2021, the scope was expanded by also including export cargo in the project. Average truck load factor has increased from less than 50 percent to over 90 percent for Milkrun-operated trucks (Schiphol, 2023). 2.4 Global digital framework The  International  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA)  is  the  trade  association  for  global  aviation, representing 83% of total air traffic (IATA, n.d.). They stipulate industry policy on critical aviation issues  for  both  passenger  and  cargo  transportation. Historically,  IATA's  Cargo-IMP  Standards were  used  by  airlines  for  cargo  interlining  since  1975. Later,  the  application  of  these  standards was  expanded  to  ground  handlers  and  freight  forwarders  (Hasnain,  2015a). Communicating effectively requires FFWs,  airlines,  and GHs to exchange standard messages. A significant cargo program was launched in 2005, namely, e-Freight, which is an industry-wide program that aims to  build  an  end-to-end  paperless  transportation  process  for  air  cargo  made  possible  with regulatory  framework  and  electronic  message  standard,  named  Cargo-XML  (Sauv,  2021). This program   aims   to   achieve   several   benefits   such   as   increased   operation   efficiency,   cost-   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 effectiveness,  improved  data  quality,  and,  importantly,  innovation  specified  as  standardization and digitization.  IATA  introduced  the  e-AWB  in  2010  with  the  objective  of  initiating  the  digitalization  of  the  air cargo  supply  chain. Working  collaboratively  within  the  cargo  supply  chain  meant  digitizing  the core industry transport documents, starting with the Air Waybill (AWB). The use of e-AWB as a means to establish the contract of carriage is only possible on feasible trade lanes. In February 2021, the feasible trade lanes represented 67% of the AWBs (Sauv, 2021). This coincides with the achieved  global  e-AWB  penetration  rate  that  between  October  2019  and  September  2020 averaged  at  68.6  percent,  with  Amsterdam  reaching  a  slightly  higher  69.2  percent  penetration (IATA, 2020b). The previously mentioned CCS manages electronic communication within airports among private operators  such  as  airlines,  GHs,  and  FFWs. It  also  includes  hinterland  road  transporters, importers, exporters, airport authorities, customs, and other relevant authorities. Most  Airport Community Systems have their own internal standards, but communicate with other systems or trade communities using specific standards. Specifically, the previously mentioned IATA Cargo- XML standards (Hasnain, 2015b).  2.4.1 Cargo iQ Cargo  iQ,  is  an  IATA-backed  global  initiative  and  non-profit  organization  to  establish  and supervise a common standard to improve the quality and reliability of operational services in the air cargo supply chain. The Industry Master Operating Plan that they released (Figure 2) outlines the   various   processes   and   sub-processes   that   are   commonly   involved   in   planning   and transporting air cargo shipments from the shipper to the final consignee (Cargo iQ, 2019). The purpose  of  the  system  is  to  analyze  the  consistency  of  shipment  planning  and  execution. A  key aspect of the program is the establishment of uniform operational procedures, which are defined and  evaluated  through  specific  \"milestones\"  and \"route  maps\"  that  represent  the  expected transportation  plan  (Markill,  2016). By  integrating  various  functions  and  needs  onto  a  single platform,  transportation  companies  and  freight  forwarders  can  gain  a  more  comprehensive understanding of the actual efficiency of their air freight supply chain using a validated approach. This  enhanced  information  can  assist  carriers,  forwarders,  and  GHs  transition  to  electronic communication methods, such as the electronic airway bill (eAWB).

air cargo shipments from the shipper to the final consignee (Cargo iQ, 2019). The purpose  of  the  system  is  to  analyze  the  consistency  of  shipment  planning  and  execution. A  key aspect of the program is the establishment of uniform operational procedures, which are defined and  evaluated  through  specific  \"milestones\"  and \"route  maps\"  that  represent  the  expected transportation  plan  (Markill,  2016). By  integrating  various  functions  and  needs  onto  a  single platform,  transportation  companies  and  freight  forwarders  can  gain  a  more  comprehensive understanding of the actual efficiency of their air freight supply chain using a validated approach. This  enhanced  information  can  assist  carriers,  forwarders,  and  GHs  transition  to  electronic communication methods, such as the electronic airway bill (eAWB).

First, the origin activities of the forwarder \"P06 Transfer shipment to carrier domain\", triggering messages/milestones (X)FHL and  (X)FWB. This  process  describes  the  information  sharing  of  shipment  information  as presented on the (e)(House) Air Waybill when it is ready to be carried over to the carrier. Then, the  origin  activities  for  the  carrier  \"P07  Receive  shipment  into  carrier  domain\",  resulting  in milestones (X)FOH and (X)RCS. This process describes the arrival and unloading of the goods at the ground handler facilities. Specifically sub-process Pd 7.2 \"Assign Unloading Slot and Position to Delivery Truck\"   as this is where the goods first arrive at the ground handler's vicinity. These processes  describe  the  handover  of  goods  and  corresponding  responsibility  between  the  freight forwarder and carrier (or its subcontracted ground handler).  2.4.2 ONE Record The  previously  mentioned  e-Freight  program  has  laid  the  groundworks  for  the  digitalization  of the air cargo industry and is now superseded by ONE Record. The IATA ONE Record data model aims  to  enhance  collaboration  and  attain  complete  supply  chain  transparency  in  the  air  cargo sector. This is achieved by establishing a consistent approach to exchanging information among various stakeholders in the supply chain, such as shippers, freight forwarders, ground handlers, airlines, and customs authorities. The goal of ONE Record is to create a seamless digital logistics and  transport  supply  chain,  where  information  can  be  easily  and  transparently  exchanged between all air cargo stakeholders, communities, and digital platforms. The driving force behind ONE  Record  is  the  need  for  the  air  cargo  industry  to  digitalize  and  streamline  operations,  by optimizing data sharing and reducing the use of paper documents (Blaj, 2020). By sharing data more timely and transparently, predictability may improve.

In the ambition, nine business dimensions are identified with proposed goals for each. For Data & Technology, an open ecosystem where airlines have a fully optimized, real-time  big  data  infrastructure  in  place  with  controlled  access  to  data  for  third  parties  is envisioned. Complete  and  real-time  cargo  visibility  across  the  end-to-end  supply  chain  using  a digital twin should be realized on the end-to-end customer journey front. According to Léopold (2018),  no  dedicated  IATA  cargo-focused  blockchain  initiative  exists  yet. Data-sharing  will  the all-encompassing because \"Ultimately, blockchain will affect every aspect of aviation ... Pretty much all the innovation in the industry involves data sharing\" (Newton, 2023, p29). In that same report,   a   partnership   with   air   cargo   giant   Kuehne+Nagel   is   described   where   blockchain technology  is  used  in  the  optimization  of  asset  management  (Newton,  2023). In  a  study  by Poleshkina  (2021),  several  airlines  such  as  Lufthansa,  British  Airways,  and  Cathay  Pacific  were found to be trialing some form of blockchain in their (cargo) operation. This study created a model that enhances the transparency of the information exchange between all air cargo transportation participants,  using  blockchain  technology. Léopold  (2018)  identified  five  areas  of    blockchain application  in  aviation:  tokenization,  provenance,  digital  ID,  certification,  and  smart  contracts.  The  scope  of  this  research  was  the  entire  aviation  industry  though,  meaning  not  all  areas  are equally  relevant  for  air  cargo. Specifically  provenance  is  suggested  as  the  technology  facilitates tracking of the status and location of assets such as cargo reliable a manner as these assets change custody. The change of custody corresponding timing is precisely where this research aims to find more  transparency. While  information  sharing  drives  costs  down,  Sahin  and  Robinson  (2004) note that the greatest financial benefit comes from coordinated decision-making. They add that mechanisms  between  stakeholders  are  crucial  to  capitalize  on  potential  savings. Technology serves an important role in this.  In   summary,   IATA   clearly   envisions   a   future   where   its   standards   and   policies   facilitate collaboration. With the introduction of ONE Record, they also aim to be the independent third party serving as a middleman between the stakeholders. While IATA's initiatives push for change on  the  digital  front,  Hasnain  (2016)  notes  that  digital  collaboration  with  business  partners  is becoming  a  necessity  throughout  the  supply  chain. This,  however,  conflicts  with  the  desire  for autonomy that the diverse stakeholders in the industry crave.  2.5 Digitalization use-cases Digitalization  adoption  varies  highly  between  (air)  ports  and  is  strongly  related  to  their  size (Brunila et al., 2021). The larger the port, the more resources can be put towards implementing digital development programs and research. The digital green lane as mentioned above aims to   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 provide a two-way solution where delivery times are communicated between GH and the trucking company.

change of custody corresponding timing is precisely where this research aims to find more  transparency. While  information  sharing  drives  costs  down,  Sahin  and  Robinson  (2004) note that the greatest financial benefit comes from coordinated decision-making. They add that mechanisms  between  stakeholders  are  crucial  to  capitalize  on  potential  savings. Technology serves an important role in this.  In   summary,   IATA   clearly   envisions   a   future   where   its   standards   and   policies   facilitate collaboration. With the introduction of ONE Record, they also aim to be the independent third party serving as a middleman between the stakeholders. While IATA's initiatives push for change on  the  digital  front,  Hasnain  (2016)  notes  that  digital  collaboration  with  business  partners  is becoming  a  necessity  throughout  the  supply  chain. This,  however,  conflicts  with  the  desire  for autonomy that the diverse stakeholders in the industry crave.  2.5 Digitalization use-cases Digitalization  adoption  varies  highly  between  (air)  ports  and  is  strongly  related  to  their  size (Brunila et al., 2021). The larger the port, the more resources can be put towards implementing digital development programs and research. The digital green lane as mentioned above aims to   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 provide a two-way solution where delivery times are communicated between GH and the trucking company. One  effective  way  to  facilitate  communication  between  trucking  companies  and terminals  for  determining  truck  arrival  times  is  by  implementing  a  truck  appointment  system (TAS). This  system  is  already  being  used  in  maritime  terminals,  across  the  globe  (Phan  &  Kim 2015). Congestion gets reduced when trucks only arrive when they can actually be handled by the terminal (Xu et al., 2021). In airports, TAS technology is known as slot management technologies are successfully applied in air cargo, such as seen in Brussels Airport, Liege Airport, Luxembourg Airport,  Vienna  Airport,  London  Heathrow,  and  Dallas  Fort-Worth  (Nallian,   n.d.). Data- processing  technology  may  be  used  to  optimize  the  use  of  the  slot  management  system  at  each GH. Historical data can be used to define required dock and staffing capacity. To further exemplify this, Brussels Airport (BRU) faced similar congestion challenges to SPL and developed its data- sharing platform BRUCloud. BRUcloud is a platform that uses a blockchain for sharing open data within  the  Brussels  cargo  community  (Ionides  et  al.,  2019). Unlike  other  cargo  community systems,  BRUcloud  facilitates  data  sharing  in  a  cloud  environment  rather  than  digitizing communication between different parties. This allows the air cargo supply chain stakeholders to work  more  closely  together  and  function  as  a  network  (BRUCloud,  n.d.). Within  BRUcloud, collaborative apps aim to make the cargo landside process paperless and future-proof (Ionides et al.,  2019). In  addition,  a  digital  slot  booking  application  in  BRUcloud  promotes  cooperation among  freight  forwarders,  ground  handlers,  and  truckers. This  helps  to  prevent  conflicts  and bottlenecks  that  used  to  result  in  congestions  (Barnett,  2018). BRUcloud  is  based  on  Nallian's data-sharing technology. The source retains control over its data and can specify which data fields are shared, with whom, and for what purpose (BRUCloud, n.d.). Currently, Nallian's slot booking and freight consolidation apps are being rolled out in multiple airports around the world such as Liege Airport, Luxembourg Airport, Vienna Airport, London Heathrow, and Dallas Fort-Worth (Nallian, n.d.) Applying slot management comes with guarantees and risks. Guarantees for a dock and service and risks through possible lack of available slots when needed. In 2023, the Port of Rotterdam has introduced a surcharge on time slots during peak hours to even out peaks of delivery trucks (Rotterdam  World  Gateway,  2023). According  to  T. Wang  et  al. (2020),  it  is  reasonable  for container  shipping  companies  to  charge  more  for  time-sensitive  cargoes  than  general  cargoes, that is, faster delivery services deserve higher freight rates. This argument cannot be made for air cargo as all shipments are time-sensitive.

Methodology This methodology outlines the research approach that was used to answer the question of how the potential of digitalization to improve export cargo flow predictability at SPL. The research focused on  identifying  digital  tools  and  strategies  in  air  cargo  suitable  for  application  at  SPL,  while drawing  parallels  with  successful  digitalization  use-cases  in  maritime  ports. The  methodology adopted  a  qualitative  research  designed  to  gain  an  in-depth  understanding  of  stakeholders' perspectives and experiences regarding digitalization's impact on export cargo predictability. This chapter describes the research design and method that were chosen for this study. Additionally, it will explain why this particular method was appropriate. Then, the data collection tool that was used, followed by a summary of the procedures and data analysis. Finally, the chapter will discuss the ethical considerations that were taken into account during the research process. 3.1 Research Design A  qualitative  multimethod  research  approach  was  used  to  explore  stakeholders'  perceptions, experiences, and insights related to digitalization of export flows at SPL. This approach provided a nuanced understanding of the implications of digital tools on improving predictability without relying on quantitative data analytics. Additionally, thorough desk research allowed to gather a comprehensive overview of technology use-cases in both the air cargo industry as well as maritime ports that helped to determine the state-of-the-art of these two industries.  3.2 Data Collection Primary  data  collection  took  place  by  means  of  semi-structured  interviews  with  key  air  cargo stakeholders  at  SPL. Interviews  were  guided  by  a  pre-determined  set  of  questions  that  allowed the interviewees to express their views on the current landside processes, challenges faced, and potential   benefits   of   digitalization. Following   the   literature   review,   an   interview   protocol containing  13  questions  was  constructed  to  guide  the  interviews. The  interview  protocol  was structured and divided into five parts: (I) introduction, (II) digital solutions, (III) challenges, (IV) operationalizing,   and (V) specific  technologies. Prior to the  interviews,  all  respondents  were handed out the interview protocol to enable them to think more deeply about the questions. The instrument was pilot-tested with a manager global operations from a large GH.  The  interview  questions  together  with  the  rationale  for  their  inclusion  in  this  study,  backed  by references to the literature, are presented in Table 1. The full interview protocol with both English and Dutch questions can be found in Appendix I.

Additionally, thorough desk research allowed to gather a comprehensive overview of technology use-cases in both the air cargo industry as well as maritime ports that helped to determine the state-of-the-art of these two industries.  3.2 Data Collection Primary  data  collection  took  place  by  means  of  semi-structured  interviews  with  key  air  cargo stakeholders  at  SPL. Interviews  were  guided  by  a  pre-determined  set  of  questions  that  allowed the interviewees to express their views on the current landside processes, challenges faced, and potential   benefits   of   digitalization. Following   the   literature   review,   an   interview   protocol containing  13  questions  was  constructed  to  guide  the  interviews. The  interview  protocol  was structured and divided into five parts: (I) introduction, (II) digital solutions, (III) challenges, (IV) operationalizing,   and (V) specific  technologies. Prior to the  interviews,  all  respondents  were handed out the interview protocol to enable them to think more deeply about the questions. The instrument was pilot-tested with a manager global operations from a large GH.  The  interview  questions  together  with  the  rationale  for  their  inclusion  in  this  study,  backed  by references to the literature, are presented in Table 1. The full interview protocol with both English and Dutch questions can be found in Appendix I.

Understand which opportunities or barriers the respondent sees. This question encourages the interviewee to think proactively about mitigation strategies for the challenges identified in the previous question. Addressing these challenges by suggesting solutions or approaches reflects a comprehensive understanding of the implementation process and indicates a forward-looking mindset. 7. How  will  an  increase  in  predictability  benefit your organization? Quantify and/or qualify the benefits for the stakeholder in question. The question seeks to highlight the direct advantages that improved predictability could bring to the company. Identifying benefits such as enhanced operational efficiency, reduced costs, improved customer satisfaction, and better resource allocation emphasizes the tangible value of embracing digital solutions. IV. Operationalizing 8. Which possible challenges do you foresee when operationalizing digital technologies? This question extends the inquiry into challenges by specifically focusing on hurdles related to the operationalization phase. By addressing challenges unique to this phase, the interviewee can demonstrate a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in integrating digital technologies into day-to-day activities. 9. Who should kickstart these initiatives? Understanding who the respondent believes should be the initial driver of digital initiatives at SPL. This question reveals insights into organizational dynamics, leadership involvement, and the level of commitment to fostering innovation and change. V. Specific technologies 10. How   would   a   dynamic   scheduling   and   slot management technology affect your organization? Explore the benefits and drawbacks of this technology and sense the respondent's feeling towards this specific technology. This allows to analyze the direct effects on operations, efficiency gains, and resource optimization, while also gauging readiness for embracing such technologies. 11. What are your thoughts on fostering horizontal cooperation among air cargo stakeholders to address landside congestion at Schiphol Airport? Since horizontal cooperation is not a novel concept at SPL, getting to know the respondent's experiences (through the  Milkrun-project). Assessing the willingness to cooperate reflects an understanding of the broader industry landscape and potential solutions beyond the organization's boundaries.

What  are  your  thoughts  on  a  third  party  being made    responsible    for    orchestrating    the    entire landside   operation   at   Schiphol,   considering   the different stakeholder requirements/business rules? This question gauges the interviewee's opinion on outsourcing or entrusting a third party with a critical aspect of operations. The response can reveal attitudes toward risk management, efficiency gains, and the potential benefits or drawbacks of involving external entities. 13. What   would   be   the   main   reasons   for   your company   to   engage   or   not   engage   in   horizontal cooperation?  By exploring the motivations for engaging in or abstaining from horizontal cooperation, the question delves into strategic considerations, perceived benefits, concerns, and alignment with the company's values and objectives. It offers insights into the interviewee's strategic mindset and decision-making criteria.   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 Secondary  data  was  collected  by  means  of  a  comprehensive  literature  review  that  explored existing studies, reports, and articles related to digitalization in air cargo. The review covered a range of topics under the digitalization umbrella such as case studies and best practices from other airports. Government  reports,  airport  publications,  and  industry  reports  were  analyzed  to understand  the  current  state  of  cargo  operations  at  SPL  and  the  initiatives  taken  towards digitalization, as well as the global developments. Moreover, existing literature on digitalization in maritime ports were examined to identify potential parallels and transferable lessons for SPL. 3.3 Sampling For this research, relevant publications were found using CataloguePlus which collection includes many  well-known  publishers,  like  Emerald,  Taylor  and  Francis,  Springer,  MDPI,  and  Elsevier.  Rather  than  predefining  a  single  set  of  search  queries,  the  applied  approach  was  of  an  iterative nature. It used multiple combinations of keywords such as air cargo, optimization, digitalization, digitization, landside, congestion, predictability, ports, digital  transformation, workforce, horizontal  cooperation, collaborative  logistics,  etc. The  keywords  were  identified  through  an iterative  process,  where  each  search  iteration's  results  were  used  to  enhance  and  improve  the search  for  better  outcomes. For  instance,  starting  with  air  cargo  optimization  as  a  key  word combination, it transitioned into horizontal cooperation in air cargo. This approach was decided upon  after  several  trial-and-error  attempts. While  this  process  was  tedious,  it  safeguards  high- inclusivity of search results. Relying solely on predefined queries could lead to missing relevant work in certain areas, posing a potential risk. A  study  was  conducted  to  expose  a  successful  use-case  of  digitalization  in  landside  cargo operations. The  study  focused  on  order  sharing  at  an  airport  similar  to  SPL. For  this,  Brussels Airport was chosen as it provided a worthy reference. While SPL processes around a four-fold of the cargo volumes compared to BRU, around half of BRU's flights are served by a national full- service carrier (FSC) operating a hub-and-spoke model, additional flights are served by a mix of low-cost airline (not contributing to cargo volumes), FSC passenger airlines (transporting limited cargo  volumes),  and  dedicated  cargo  airlines. Geographically,  BRU  and  AMS  are  close  and  are serviced by many of the same stakeholders (CAPA, 2023a; CAPA, 2023b).  The  research  draws  parallels  with  digitalization  strategies  implemented  in  maritime  shipping ports. Comparative analysis will highlight similarities and differences in the application of digital tools  in  improving  export  cargo  predictability,  enabling  the  transfer  of  best  practices  from  the maritime sector to the aviation industry. Digitalization has proved useful in facing the landside operations challenges in ports. Therefore, analyzing how different ports have reduced congestion, waiting  times,  and  emissions  (from  idle  trucks)  through  digitalization  was  deemed  a  suitable method.   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 Semi-structured interviews were held with respondents who were selected using convenience and snowball sampling methods. The goal was to ensure fair representation from different stakeholder groups  involved  in  the  digitalization  of  air  cargo  export  flows,  thereby  capturing  diverse perspectives. Stakeholders  were  identified  and  included:  GH,  FFW,  trucking  companies,  and airlines. Two separate companies were selected and interviewed per stakeholder, with the notable exception  that  one  airline  performs  self-handling,  and  the  focus  in  the  interview  was  on  GH activities,  not  airline  activities  (Ground  handler  3). Additionally,  an  IT  solution provider  was interviewed. A  key  requirement  for  the  respondents  was  to  have  decision-making  authority  on digitalization strategy or have been involved with digitalization in a project leader role. The full overview of interviewees can be found in Table 2.

The  interviews  were conducted online through Microsoft Teams and lasted between 32 and 57 minutes, averaging 43 minutes. All interviews were conducted in the Dutch language, recorded, and transcribed. Quotes relevant  for  conclusions  were  translated  into  English. Following  the  interviews,  a  six-phase thematic  analysis  as  defined  by  Braun  and  Clarke  (2006)  was  employed  to  identify  patterns, themes,   and   recurring   ideas   related   to   digitalization's   potential   to   improve   cargo   flow predictability.

This  method  of  analysis  was  chosen  as  it  is  known  as  a  good  qualitative  research method that is widely used across a range of epistemologies and research questions (Nowell et al., 2017). The method was used to analyze, organize, describe, and report themes found within the collected dataset (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The nine conducted and recorded interviews provided the source of information for the thematic analysis. MS Teams was used for the interviews and automatically   transcribed.

The  interviews  were conducted online through Microsoft Teams and lasted between 32 and 57 minutes, averaging 43 minutes. All interviews were conducted in the Dutch language, recorded, and transcribed. Quotes relevant  for  conclusions  were  translated  into  English. Following  the  interviews,  a  six-phase thematic  analysis  as  defined  by  Braun  and  Clarke  (2006)  was  employed  to  identify  patterns, themes,   and   recurring   ideas   related   to   digitalization's   potential   to   improve   cargo   flow predictability.

This  method  of  analysis  was  chosen  as  it  is  known  as  a  good  qualitative  research method that is widely used across a range of epistemologies and research questions (Nowell et al., 2017). The method was used to analyze, organize, describe, and report themes found within the collected dataset (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The nine conducted and recorded interviews provided the source of information for the thematic analysis. MS Teams was used for the interviews and automatically   transcribed. A   thorough   manual   verification   of   the   transcription   was   done afterwards  and  then  meticulously  coded  in  two  runs. Key  concepts  in  the  transcripts  that  are important  to  this  research  were  identified  with  the  aid  of  coding. The  themes  and  sub-themes were then developed using the codes that emerged from the data as the basis. Finalizing with the names  of  each  theme  and  sub-theme,  writing  a  description  of  each  theme,  and  citing  examples from the original text to support each description. Based on the findings from the primary data analysis,  potential  digital  tools  and  technologies  applicable  to  improve  export cargo  flows  at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and their stimulators and inhibitors were identified. The selection of  digital  tools  was  guided  by  stakeholders'  perspectives  and  experiences  shared  during  the interviews. By conducting thorough desk research, a comprehensive overview of the technology use-cases in both the air cargo industry and maritime ports was gathered. This helped determine the current state-of-the-art in these sectors. The findings were categorized under the themes from the  thematic  analysis  and  compared  and  contrasted  with  each  other. A  count  was  kept  of  the occurrence  per  sub-theme,  leading  to  a  total  theme  weight,  indicating  the  respective  theme's importance.  In  summary,  the  methodology  employed  a  qualitative  approach,  including  semi-structured interviews  with  key  stakeholders  and  a  comprehensive  literature  review. Thematic  analysis  of interviews  helped  identify  digital  tools,  and  comparative  analysis  with  maritime  ports  provided insights. In the next chapter, the interview's findings are laid out.

Findings 4.1 Interview output Following nine interviews, thematic analysis was used to distill several themes from the interview for further analysis. A total of 103 non-unique codes were identified between the nine interviews. These  codes  were  grouped  into  17  sub-themes  and  five  main  themes. Table 3  shows  all  sub- themes, their related main themes and respective weights.  Table 3 Main and sub-themes derived from thematic analysis Sub-theme Count Theme Theme weight Just-in-time 2 Flexibility  18  Need for speed 5 Predictable 4 Flexibility 7 Business rules 8 Industry change  42 Change management 6 Development times 2 Innovation restrictors 10 Long introduction lead time 3 Responsibility 13 Interface technology 1 Interface technology 1 Financial incentives 4 Network technology 38 Horizontal collaboration 13 Interconnectivity  8 Slot management 12 Autonomous vehicles 1 Physical change 5 Infrastructure 4    Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 One of the main themes was considered out of scope for this research but was a returning theme nonetheless,  highlighting  a  specific  desire  or  idea  from  those  stakeholder. Specifically,  physical change was a common theme and included sub-themes such as the use of autonomous vehicles and infrastructure modifications. These solutions have the potential to reduce congestion whilst they have no relation to digitalization. 4.2 Flexibility While  GHs  perceive  a  high  level  of  unpredictability  in  export  deliveries,  FFWs  and  trucking companies believe the opposite. Four stakeholders agree that air cargo is in fact predictable to a large extend citing that around 80% of all flows are standard with 20% variability. Regarding the unpredictability, respondent E firmly stated \"A lot of people say that air cargo is unpredictable to  which  I  say:  that's  not  true. That's  just  not  true.\". Five of  the  respondents  emphasized  that high speed and flexibility is what makes air transport an interesting modality for FFWs and their customers. FFWs work according to latest acceptance time (LAT) which indicates a certain time before departure by when the shipment needs to be delivered to the GH. Both FFWs and trucking companies  stated  that  it  is  their  core-business  to  consolidate  shipments  to  optimize  their movements between their own warehouses and the GHs as much as possible. Only between 60 and 90 minutes before arrived to the GH, the trucking company sends a notification to the GH detailing which shipments are on its way. Opinions differed between how flexible this timeframe is. Respondent H suggested that ideally, this number gets brought up to three to four hours before goods get delivered to the GH. This should provide the GH with more time to guarantee adequate service. Freight forwarder 2 and Ground handler 3 idealized using a just-in-time method for air cargo, where shipments are delivered to the GH premises when they are needed. Other flexibility issues  include  stakeholders  not  wanting  to  give  up  on  flexibility  both  from  an  operational perspective and a software procurement perspective. Most respondents believe that adding more time  to  allow  for  more  efficient  consolidation  and  truck  movements  is  not  possible. Freight forwarder 1 specified this further by saying they are not in the position to change their customers' production. A notable exception was Freight forwarder 1, saying that it has the ability to demand from its customers that cargo is made available sooner, potentially with financial stimuli: \"If you say  to  your  customer:  listen,  we  can  ship  it  for  €  1  cheaper,  but  then  I  want  to  pick  it  up  on Thursday instead of Friday. Then the customer will take care of that.\". 4.3 Interface technology Only  one  of  the  interviewed  stakeholders  mentioned  any  interface  technology.

work according to latest acceptance time (LAT) which indicates a certain time before departure by when the shipment needs to be delivered to the GH. Both FFWs and trucking companies  stated  that  it  is  their  core-business  to  consolidate  shipments  to  optimize  their movements between their own warehouses and the GHs as much as possible. Only between 60 and 90 minutes before arrived to the GH, the trucking company sends a notification to the GH detailing which shipments are on its way. Opinions differed between how flexible this timeframe is. Respondent H suggested that ideally, this number gets brought up to three to four hours before goods get delivered to the GH. This should provide the GH with more time to guarantee adequate service. Freight forwarder 2 and Ground handler 3 idealized using a just-in-time method for air cargo, where shipments are delivered to the GH premises when they are needed. Other flexibility issues  include  stakeholders  not  wanting  to  give  up  on  flexibility  both  from  an  operational perspective and a software procurement perspective. Most respondents believe that adding more time  to  allow  for  more  efficient  consolidation  and  truck  movements  is  not  possible. Freight forwarder 1 specified this further by saying they are not in the position to change their customers' production. A notable exception was Freight forwarder 1, saying that it has the ability to demand from its customers that cargo is made available sooner, potentially with financial stimuli: \"If you say  to  your  customer:  listen,  we  can  ship  it  for  €  1  cheaper,  but  then  I  want  to  pick  it  up  on Thursday instead of Friday. Then the customer will take care of that.\". 4.3 Interface technology Only  one  of  the  interviewed  stakeholders  mentioned  any  interface  technology. Person   B mentioned  the  use of an  RFID  and a camera-based monitoring system as an option for SPL. It was highlighted that the limitation of such a system that this can only be used reactively and most   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 knowledge gained from such a monitoring system is a repeat of history. Adding \"It is not about how to visualize it. It is about how to break through that pattern of congestion\". 4.4 Network technology Most   stakeholders   acknowledge   further interconnectivity   and   subsequent   data-sharing   is possible, potentially through Cargonaut's platform, APIs are extensively used to link GH systems to Cargonaut and sometimes directly to FFWs says Person A. eLink is used by trucking companies to inform GHs that a truck is coming and includes detailed shipment information. As mentioned in the flexibility theme, the timeframe in which this information becomes available to the GH is very short. Both trucking companies and all GHs agreed on this. A single digital portal is seen as desirable by Freight  forwarder  1. On  the  contrary, Ground  handler  1  prefers  using  their  own internal systems and then use APIs to link systems. Every single stakeholder sees value in the use slot  management  to  combat  congestion. While  some  see  the  use  of  slots  as  a  means  to  an  end, others  see  it  as  the  \"holy  grail\". Slot  times  are  used  at  different  scales. Ground  handler  1  for example uses slots in an informal way by means of email. Ground handler 2 on the other hand is going  to  transition  to  a  fully  slot-managed  operation  when  their  new  facility  opens  in  2024. In differing levels, stakeholders are apprehensive to use slots for 100% of the operation. Especially fears regarding the non-availability of slots when an important shipment needs to be delivered is mentioned  by  both Ground  handler  3,   Freight  forwarder  1,   Ground  handler  2,   and Ground handler 1. Following the fear for lack of slots, financial incentives are mentioned several times to allow for flexibility if the need arises. Respondent H would refuse to pay for regular slots as this should  be \"part  of  the  normal  service  of  a  GH\". Horizontal  collaboration  is  a  concept  known amongst all stakeholders who were interviewed. If not by the theoretical name, then by horizontal collaboration project at SPL: Milkrun. Both Ground handler 2 and Ground handler 3 provide their own  import  delivery  services,  not  participating  in  the  Milkrun  import  program. For  example, between 50 and 60 percent of Ground handler 2's import shipments are self-delivered to freight forwarders, largely bolstered by high e-commerce volumes. All three GH stakeholders currently participate in the export Milkrun albeit in low volumes. Generally, horizontal collaboration is seen as a positive development. The benefits and savings are acknowledged. However, criticism is given on the scalability of the concept. Citing that aviation is an interesting modality for shippers due to its speed. Building in additional time to optimize deliveries is seen by Freight forwarder 1 as undesirable fearing this will increase shipment lead times. A notable exception to this is Person E who  believes  an  export  Milkrun  service  can  be  lucrative  for  all  FFWs,  especially  the  smaller players. Both trucking companies highlighted that their companies are already actively engaged in  consolidation  shipments  from  forwarders  throughout  the  week. Pickups  are    combined  with return journeys from the hinterland. This, in principle, overlaps with the concept that is Milkrun export. An interesting initiative was highlighted by Trucking company 1 as they currently run a   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 low-tech pilot where they agreed with a GH to have a dedicated dock available 24/7 that is shared amongst three trucking companies. Rather than waiting for a platform to be developed, planners of the respective companies use WhatsApp to agree which company utilizes the dock at what time. Respondent H also notes that while much information is received regarding freight, it still occurs that dimensions are missing or incorrect or that stacking turns out to not be permitted or possible. This affects how well their planners can optimize trucks.  4.5 Industry change Five out of nine interviewees see a clear role for Schiphol Airport as the airport operator to initiate the  next  steps  in  digitalization  and  trigger  an  industry  change. One  such  steps  could  be  to  set targets for Milkrun participation or slot management implementation. Three stakeholders believe that  the  local  air  cargo  community  can  push  and  achieve  change,  while Person  B  believes  that agreements  regarding  delivery  times  and  data  sharing  is  part  of  the  contractual  agreement between  the  airline  and  its  GH. As  mentioned  above,  the  benefits  of  slot  management  are recognized. Six stakeholders added a desire for strong business rules when using slot management technology. Ground handler 3 specified this by addressing the need for transparent community agreements  that  don't  differ  per  GH  and  especially  how  to  prioritize  when  needed. Such agreements  should  then  be  used  to  hold  stakeholders  accountable,  Person  H  added, where  the role of a single responsible entity comes in. A big shift in mindset is needed to achieve the next steps in digitalization Person E believes. Change management was a recurring subtheme amongst stakeholders with new (internal) company structures stated by Trucking company 1 and Ground handler  1. Development  times  and  costs  of  collaborative  tools  are  seen  as  difficult  by Ground handler 1 and Ground handler 3. Ground handler 3 addressed the lengthy procurement process that  is  required  by  corporate  and  therefore  prefer  to  do  in-house  software  development.

Respondent H also notes that while much information is received regarding freight, it still occurs that dimensions are missing or incorrect or that stacking turns out to not be permitted or possible. This affects how well their planners can optimize trucks.  4.5 Industry change Five out of nine interviewees see a clear role for Schiphol Airport as the airport operator to initiate the  next  steps  in  digitalization  and  trigger  an  industry  change. One  such  steps  could  be  to  set targets for Milkrun participation or slot management implementation. Three stakeholders believe that  the  local  air  cargo  community  can  push  and  achieve  change,  while Person  B  believes  that agreements  regarding  delivery  times  and  data  sharing  is  part  of  the  contractual  agreement between  the  airline  and  its  GH. As  mentioned  above,  the  benefits  of  slot  management  are recognized. Six stakeholders added a desire for strong business rules when using slot management technology. Ground handler 3 specified this by addressing the need for transparent community agreements  that  don't  differ  per  GH  and  especially  how  to  prioritize  when  needed. Such agreements  should  then  be  used  to  hold  stakeholders  accountable,  Person  H  added, where  the role of a single responsible entity comes in. A big shift in mindset is needed to achieve the next steps in digitalization Person E believes. Change management was a recurring subtheme amongst stakeholders with new (internal) company structures stated by Trucking company 1 and Ground handler  1. Development  times  and  costs  of  collaborative  tools  are  seen  as  difficult  by Ground handler 1 and Ground handler 3. Ground handler 3 addressed the lengthy procurement process that  is  required  by  corporate  and  therefore  prefer  to  do  in-house  software  development. Respondent H on horizontal collaboration made an argument that \"Yes. Theoretically optimizing, consolidating full trucks is something you'd say yes to. Practically it's quite something ... putting certain parties in a position of disadvantage\", later adding that part of a trucking company's core business is commerce. If freedom is lost there, \"it's simply not interesting for us to engage in\". Freight forwarder 1 took a similar stance in this, citing the current differing rates for customers. Several  critical  remarks  were  made  towards  the  GH  that  no  matter  the  proposed  plans  for digitalization, staffing levels need to be sufficient to meet the demand.

Discussion and conclusion This study set out to explore how digitalization can help improve export cargo flows at SPL. The outcomes  provide  an  overview  of  technologies  that  can  alleviate  congestion. A  qualitative multimethod  study containing an  extensive  literature  review  and  nine stakeholder  interviews exposed the following significant findings: • Transparent business rules need to be agreed upon between stakeholders; • Dynamic scheduling and slot management will provide details on available dock capacity at GHs; • Horizontal  collaboration  can  be  expanded  to  optimize  truck  load  factors  and  reduce movements ; • Traffic  monitoring  technology  can  help  trucking  companies  to  better  understand  real- time traffic information at SPL landside.  Most surprisingly, it is not technology that forms a stumbling block to kickstart the next step in the digital transformation at SPL,  instead, the agreements on how to effectively use technologies between the stakeholders pose the most significant challenge to SPL's air cargo community. 5.1 Transparent business rules A strong desire for flexibility became apparent during the interviews. Existing fears regarding the loss of flexibility needs to be adequately managed. Tijan et al. (2021) emphasized the necessity to take into account the individual stakeholder preferences when developing integrated community systems. More  than  150  local  freight  forwarders  currently  operate  at  SPL,  amounting  to  high variation of preferences. Besides that, the flexibility and the high-speed nature of air cargo and how  it  affects  congestion  seems  to  be  largely overlooked  in  academic  sources. While  the hypothesis  of  this  research  centered around unpredictability, stakeholders believe that, at least for the most part, export flows are in fact predictable. Stating that everybody in the industry knows which  days  see  a  peak  in  deliveries,  just  not  the  specifics  on  a  shipment-level. In  particular, trucking  companies  experience  that  GHs  don't  have  enough  staff  available  and  believe  that through transparent business rules and agreements, stakeholder can be held accountable. If this was entirely the case, then congestion could be fully solved by increasing GH staff and equipment. Till  now,  administrative  duties  have  increased  for  FFWs  and  trucking  companies  while  the benefits of those efforts have yet to be experienced. Schiphol Airport is seen as the single entity that should be tasked to lead the digital transformation at SPL. This is in line with what was found in other (air) ports like Brussels Airports, Port of Rotterdam, and Port of Mombasa. ACN could gather stakeholder preferences to be used by Schiphol Airport in drafting requirements.    Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 5.2 Dynamic scheduling and slot management By  far  the  biggest  impact  can  be  achieved  by  implementing  slot  management  technology  to regulate air cargo deliveries to the GH facility. Both in maritime ports and airports, this type of technology  has  lead  to  a  decrease  in  congestion,   shortening  delivery  times  between  FFWs  and GHs,  reducing  harmful  emissions,  and  financial  savings  for  trucking  companies  and  their customers. Clear and transparent agreements must be agreed upon to create a fair system that caters to the known and predictable export cargo flows while leaving flexibility in dock capacity for high-priority, or for other reasons late shipments. Details such as minimum required datasets for slot bookings need to be agreed on by all parties. As flexibility is seen as a key selling point for shippers,  the  desire  for  flexibility  within  a  rigid  scheduling system is  necessary. Financial incentives are deemed a good tool to stimulate the use of the fixed and known slots for roughly 80% of flows while retaining a layer of 20% for flexibility. Simultaneously, this can generate an additional source of income for the GH to finance additional flexibility.  5.3 Horizontal collaboration While  horizontal  collaboration  in  itself  is  not  a  digital  tool,  transcending  cooperation  between stakeholders needs to be facilitated by adequate digital tools. Previous research on this topic have highlighted  the  potential  benefits,  although  counter  arguments  for  its  gains  also  exist. The sensitivity  of  this  topic  is  strongly  seen  by  the  responses  of  the  trucking  companies. Trucking companies  already  consolidate  shipments  from  FFWs  in  their  warehouses  as  they are  able  to combine hinterland journeys to their   airport warehouses in a way that cannot be done when using only   horizontal   collaboration. Despite   the   air   cargo   industry's   desire   to   push   towards digitalization  and  the  need  for  sharing  data,  as  suggested  by  Zaheer  and  Trkman  (2017)  there remains a stark difference between FFW stakeholders' willingness to share information. Where DHL  is  very  open  to  change,  Geodis  takes  a  much  more  hesitant  stance  towards  sharing information  or  even  truck

Clear and transparent agreements must be agreed upon to create a fair system that caters to the known and predictable export cargo flows while leaving flexibility in dock capacity for high-priority, or for other reasons late shipments. Details such as minimum required datasets for slot bookings need to be agreed on by all parties. As flexibility is seen as a key selling point for shippers,  the  desire  for  flexibility  within  a  rigid  scheduling system is  necessary. Financial incentives are deemed a good tool to stimulate the use of the fixed and known slots for roughly 80% of flows while retaining a layer of 20% for flexibility. Simultaneously, this can generate an additional source of income for the GH to finance additional flexibility.  5.3 Horizontal collaboration While  horizontal  collaboration  in  itself  is  not  a  digital  tool,  transcending  cooperation  between stakeholders needs to be facilitated by adequate digital tools. Previous research on this topic have highlighted  the  potential  benefits,  although  counter  arguments  for  its  gains  also  exist. The sensitivity  of  this  topic  is  strongly  seen  by  the  responses  of  the  trucking  companies. Trucking companies  already  consolidate  shipments  from  FFWs  in  their  warehouses  as  they are  able  to combine hinterland journeys to their   airport warehouses in a way that cannot be done when using only   horizontal   collaboration. Despite   the   air   cargo   industry's   desire   to   push   towards digitalization  and  the  need  for  sharing  data,  as  suggested  by  Zaheer  and  Trkman  (2017)  there remains a stark difference between FFW stakeholders' willingness to share information. Where DHL  is  very  open  to  change,  Geodis  takes  a  much  more  hesitant  stance  towards  sharing information  or  even  truck  space. Blockchain  is  frequently  proposed  in  papers  to  play  a  role  in digitalization. While the technology itself does not have the ability to solve congestion, it can be used  in  data-sharing  platforms  where its  high data  security  could  be  beneficial. Especially reluctant stakeholder that fear exposing sensitive information may be appealed by blockchain's information integrity.  5.4 Traffic monitoring technology IoT technology could have a strong use case in traffic monitoring at the different GHs. By using IoT  sensors  and  cameras,  traffic  patterns  such  as  vehicle  speed  and  the  volume  of  vehicles  at specific  chokepoints  on  the  landside  area  of  SPL  can  be  recorded  and  monitored. FFWs  and trucking  companies  can  use  this  information  to  reroute  trucks  to  parts  where  there  is  less   Madrid Campus: C / Numancia 6, 28039 Madrid Barcelona Campus: C / Aragon 179, 08011 Barcelona info@global-business-school.org +34 930 086 588 congestion. While this is a useful tool, its reactive nature makes is more suitable for short-term gains than long-term change as it is not a solution for congestion.  5.5 Relation to other and future studies Studies on air cargo optimization at SPL mostly focused on import shipments. While this is not an unexpected observation, as the time-pressure of making it to the booked cargo flight is off, it leaves room for export optimization. Research aimed specifically at export took a single concept and explored that into detail. This study served to broaden the literature by addressing available digitalization opportunities. During  the  investigations,  the  research  scope  was  limited  to  local export deliveries. In reality,  infrastructure such as landside roads, security gates, docks, and GH staff are shared between local export flows, local import flows, and import and export RFS. The findings as presented here do therefore not display the full complexity of landside operations at SPL. Further studies could explore how (international) RFS export flows can be combined with local  cargo  deliveries  without  creating  bottlenecks  and  optimizing  freight  availability  at  GH.  Moreover,  upcoming  research  could  investigate  best  practices  to  define  business  rules  for  slot management  systems. Moving  away  from  management  and  taking  an  economics  approach  to horizontal  cooperation  could  give  way  for  cooperative  game  theory  models  to  be developed  to explore  which  strategies  could  best benefit  stakeholders  involved. A  social  study  into  the stakeholder  change  management  and  willingness  to  adapt  could  disclose  methods  to  help stakeholders deal with digital transformation.

Recommendations For being one of Europe's largest airports, SPL has a very advanced CSS facilitated by Cargonaut and  bolsters  high  integration  of  FFW,  GH,  airline,  trucking,  and  customs. Partly  due  to  (inter) national requirements, shipment information is available in a digital format and can be shared easily  amongst  community  members. Still, frequent congestion occurs, leading to financial and ecological  losses,  not  to  mention  the  personal  effect  this  has  on  employees  in  the  operations. Digitalization  has  the  potential  to  significantly  enhance  the  predictability  of  export  cargo  flows and combat congestion at SPL. The following actions are therefore recommended.  First, Schiphol  Airport  should  rise  to  the  occasion  and  mandate  a  strategy for  the  future digitalization  of  its  local  air  cargo  industry. This  strategy  should  include  the  use  of  slot management for  export  flows  at  GH  facilities. Based  on  historic  data, GHs  should determine  a nominal   and   maximum   operating   capacity   on   which   dock   capacity   is   defined. A   clear differentiation must be made between fixed export deliveries and flexible export delivery capacity. Moreover, horizontal collaboration through the Milkrun export concept should be expanded and be made more attractive for smaller FFWs. Also, a short-term  installation of traffic monitoring technology to be used by FFWs and trucking companies should provide better insights into where peaks occur and better route optimizing can be achieved. Lastly, Schiphol Airport should define a baseline  set  of  business  rules  to  be  used  between  stakeholders. These  can  then  be  used  by stakeholders in  a  way  similar  to  regulation:  more  stringent  is  allowed,  less  stringent  is  not.  Compliance  monitoring  of  stakeholders  regarding  these  business  rules  by  Schiphol  Airport  is paramount.

A   clear differentiation must be made between fixed export deliveries and flexible export delivery capacity. Moreover, horizontal collaboration through the Milkrun export concept should be expanded and be made more attractive for smaller FFWs. Also, a short-term  installation of traffic monitoring technology to be used by FFWs and trucking companies should provide better insights into where peaks occur and better route optimizing can be achieved. Lastly, Schiphol Airport should define a baseline  set  of  business  rules  to  be  used  between  stakeholders. These  can  then  be  used  by stakeholders in  a  way  similar  to  regulation:  more  stringent  is  allowed,  less  stringent  is  not.  Compliance  monitoring  of  stakeholders  regarding  these  business  rules  by  Schiphol  Airport  is paramount.

How does the unpredictability of export cargo flows affect your company if it does? II. Digital solutions 3. Which   digital   technologies   do   you   think   could   be   implemented   to   increase predictability? 4. How could you implement this in your organization? III. Challenges 5. Which challenges do you expect when implementing digital technologies? 6. What could you do to alleviate these challenges? 7. How will an increase in predictability benefit your organization? IV. Operationalizing 8. Which possible challenges do you foresee when operationalizing digital technologies? 9. Who should kickstart these initiatives? V. Specific technologies Please read the following definitions: Dynamic  scheduling  and  slot  management  technology  center around a collaborative application   that   enables   the   cargo   community' s   ground   handlers,   freight forwarders,  and  trucking  companies  to  better  coordinate  their  freight  handling processes. Horizontal  collaboration  involves  companies  operating  at  the  same  value  chain  level but usually in different chains. For example, trucking companies A and B operate at  the  same  value  chain  level  while  serving  different  freight  forwarders. They collaborate  by  sharing  capacity,  planning,  handling  services,  and  possibly  even booking services.

Horizontal collaboration gaat het om bedrijven die op hetzelfde waardeketenniveau opereren,  maar  meestal  in  verschillende  ketens. Vrachtwagenbedrijven  A  en  B werken  bijvoorbeeld  op  hetzelfde  waardeketenniveau  en  bedienen  verschillende expediteurs. Ze werken samen door capaciteit te delen, te plannen, diensten af te handelen en mogelijk zelfs diensten te boeken.  10. Hoe zou dynamic scheduling and slot management uw organisatie beïnvloeden?

Important Safety instructions Read these instructions. Keep these instructions. Heed all warnings. Follow all instructions. CAUTION RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK DO NOT OPEN CAUTION : TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK DO NOT REMOVE COVER (OR BACK). NO USER SERVICEABLE PARTS INSIDE. REFER TO QUALIFIED SERVICE PERSONNEL. The symbol is intended to alert the user to the presence of uninsulated dangerous voltage within the product’s enclosure that may be of sufficient magnitude to constitute a risk of electric shock to persons. The symbol is intended to alert the user to the presence of important operating and maintenance (servicing) instructions in the literature accompanying the device. WARNING : TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE AND ELECTRIC SHOCK, DO NOT EXPOSE THIS PRODUCT TO RAIN OR MOISTURE. •Do not use this apparatus near water. •Clean only with dry cloth. •Do not block any ventilation openings. Install in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. •Do not install near any heat sources such as radiators, heat registers, stoves, or other apparatus (including amplifiers) that produce heat. •Do not defeat the safety purpose of the polarized or grounding-type plug. A polarized plug has two blades with one wider than the other. A grounding type plug has two blades and a third grounding prong. The wide blade or the third prong are provided for your safety. If the provided plug does not fit into your outlet, consult an electrician for replacement of the obsolete outlet. •Protect the power cord from being walked on or pinched particularly at plugs, convenience receptacles, and the point where they exit from the apparatus. •Only use attachments/accessories specified by the manufacturer. •Use only with the cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table specified by the manufacturer, or sold with the apparatus. When a cart is used, use caution when moving the cart/apparatus combination to avoid injury from tip-over. •Unplug this apparatus during lightning storms or when unused for long periods of time. •Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing is required when the apparatus has been damaged in any way, such as power-supply cord or plug is damaged, liquid has been spilled or objects have fallen into the apparatus, the apparatus has been exposed to rain or moisture, does not operate normally, or has been dropped. •Do not press strongly upon the panel with a hand or a sharp object such as a nail, pencil, or pen, or make a scratch on it. •Do not stick metal objects or any other conductive material into the power cord. Do not touch the end of the power cord while it is plugged in. •Keep the packing anti-moisture material or vinyl packing out of the reach of children. Anti-moisture material is harmful if swallowed. If swallowed, induce vomiting and go to the nearest hospital. Additionally, vinyl packing can cause suffocation. Keep it out of the reach of children. •Concerning the Power Cord (Can differ by country): Check the specification page of this owner’s manual to be certain concerning current requirements. Do not connect too many devices to the same AC power outlet as this could result in fire or electric shock. Do not overload wall outlets. Overloaded wall outlets, loose or damaged wall outlets, extension cords, frayed power cords, or damaged or cracked wire insulation are dangerous. Any of these conditions could result in electric shock or fire.    3 ENGLISH Periodically examine the cord of your device, and if its appearance indicates damage or deterioration, unplug it, discontinue use of the device, and have the cord replaced with an exact replacement part by an authorized servicer. Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted, kinked, pinched, closed in a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs, wall outlets, and the point where the cord exits the device. Do not move the TV with the power cord plugged in. Do not use a damaged or loose power cord. Be sure do grasp the plug when unplugging the power cord. Do not pull on the power cord to unplug the TV. •To reduce the risk of fire or electrical shock, do not expose this product to rain, moisture or other liquids. Do not touch the TV with wet hands.

Troubleshooting •Cannot control the TV with the remote control. -Check if anything such as tape has been placed over the receiver. -Check if there is any obstacle between the product and the remote control. -Replace the batteries with new fresh ones. •No image display and no sound is produced. -Check if the product is turned on. -Check if the power cord is connected to a wall outlet. -Check if there is a problem in the wall outlet by connecting other products. •The TV turns off suddenly. -Check the power control settings. The power supply may be interrupted. -Check if the Timer Power Off / Sleep Timer feature is activated in the Timers settings. -If there is no signal while the TV is on, the TV will turn off automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity. •Abnormal Display -If the TV feels cold to the touch, there may be a small flicker when it is turned on. This is normal; there is nothing wrong with TV. Some minute dot defects may be visible on the screen, appearing as tiny red, green, or blue spots. However, they have no adverse effect on the TV’s performance. Avoid touching the screen or holding your finger(s) against it for long periods of time. Doing so may produce some temporary distortion effects on the screen. -This panel is an advanced product that contains millions of pixels. In a very few cases, you could see fine dots on the screen while you’re viewing the TV. Those dots are deactivated pixels and do not affect the performance and reliability of the TV. -Displaying a still image for a prolonged period of time may cause an image sticking. Avoid displaying a fixed image on the TV screen for a extended length of time. -Some horizontal lines may appear when the Pixel Refresher feature is performed. It is normal and there is no need to be concerned. •Generated Sound -Cracking noise A cracking noise that occurs when watching or turning off the TV is generated by plastic thermal contraction due to temperature and humidity. This noise is common for products where thermal deformation is required. -Electrical circuit humming/panel buzzing A low level noise is generated from a high- speed switching circuit, which supplies a large amount of current to operate a product. It varies depending upon the product. This generated sound does not affect the performance and reliability of the product. 12 ENGLISH Specifications Product specifications may be changed without prior notice due to upgrade of product functions.

Never place a television set in an unstable location. A television set may fall, causing serious personal injury or death. Many injuries, particularly to children, can be avoided by taking simple precautions such as: •Using cabinets or stands recommended by the manufacturer of the television set. •Only using furniture that can safely support the television set. •Ensuring the television set is not overhanging the edge of the supporting furniture. •Not placing the television set on tall furniture (for example, cupboards or bookcases) without anchoring both the furniture and the television set to a suitable support. •Not placing the television set on cloth or other materials that may be located between the television set and supporting furniture. •Educating children about the dangers of climbing on furniture to reach the television set or its controls. If your existing television set is being retained and relocated, the same considerations as above should be applied. Symbols Refers to alternating current (AC). Refers to direct current (DC). Refers to class II equipment. Refers to stand-by. Refers to “ON” (power). Refers to dangerous voltage.             THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CARES •  Manufacturers,  retailers  and  the  rest  of  the  consumer  electronics  industry  are  committed  to making home entertainment safe and enjoyable. •  As you enjoy your television, please note that all televisions – new and old- must be supported on proper stands or installed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Televisions that are inappropriately situated on dressers, bookcases, shelves, desks, speakers, chests, carts, etc., may fall over, resulting in injury. TUNE IN TO SAFETY •  ALWAYS follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for the safe installation of your television. •  ALWAYS read and follow all instructions for proper use of your television. •  NEVER allow children to climb on or play on the television or the furniture on which the television is placed. •  NEVER  place  the  television  on  furniture  that  can  easily  be  used  as  steps,  such  as  a  chest  of drawers. •  ALWAYS install the television where it cannot be pushed, pulled over or knocked down. •  ALWAYS  route  cords  and  cables  connected  to  the  television  so  that  they  cannot  be  tripped over, pulled or grabbed. WALL OR CEILING MOUNT YOUR TELEVISION •  ALWAYS contact your retailer about professional installation if you have any doubts about your ability to safely mount your television. •  ALWAYS use a mount that has been recommended by the television manufacturer and has a safety certification by an independent laboratory (such as UL, CSA, ETL). •  ALWAYS follow all instructions supplied by the television and mount manufacturers. •  ALWAYS make sure that the wall or ceiling where you are mounting the television is appropriate. Some mounts are not designed to be mounted to walls and ceilings with steel studs or cinder block construction. If you are unsure, contact a professional installer. •  Televisions  can  be  heavy. A  minimum  of  two  people  is  required  for  a  wall  or  ceiling  mount installation. MOVING  AN  OLDER  TELEVISION  TO  A  NEW  PLACE  IN YOUR HOME •  Many new television buyers move their older CRT televisions into a secondary room after the purchase of a flat-panel television. Special care should be made in the placement of older CRT televisions. •  ALWAYS place your older CRT television on furniture that is sturdy and appropriate for its size and weight. •  NEVER place your older CRT television on a dresser where children may be tempted to use the drawers to climb. •  ALWAYS make sure your older CRT television does not hang over the edge of your furniture.

(Home)   (Settings)   (All Settings)  General  About This TV  Software Version •Check if the same symptom occurs with two or more Wi-Fi devices. -Wi-Fi problems may be related to network condition and a device that is connected to the network. -If other Wi-Fi devices can connect to the Internet at the same location as the TV, then your Wi-Fi router is probably normal. •Check the power and Ethernet cables of the Wi-Fi router. -When the Ethernet cable connected to the Wi-Fi router is loose or disconnected, network problems can occur. -Check all power and Ethernet cables of the Wi-Fi router to see if they are correctly connected. •Check the Wi-Fi router to see if the router is set to the recommended wireless settings. If network problems continue, reset your network devices. •Check the signal strength of the Wi-Fi router to connect to from the TV UI. -The  that is next to the Wi-Fi router name (SSID) in the menu indicates the sensitivity of the receiver. -It is recommended that you connect to a Wi-Fi network with 3 or more bars of signal strength. -If the number of bars indicating signal strength are less than 3, the network connection status may be weak or unstable, so shorten the distance between the Wi-Fi router and the TV. •If the signal strength of the Wi-Fi router is weak, wireless speed slowdowns and network disconnection may occur. •To supplement wireless coverage of network equipment, your Wi-Fi router should be placed in the middle of the network equipment. Wi-Fi Router ENGLISH •Interference Factors If there is any interference from surrounding equipment, the network connection may be weak or unstable. -Wireless telephones that operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth -Wireless speakers that operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth -Video transmitters that operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth -Other wireless devices (Microwaves, cameras, baby monitors, neighboring wireless devices, etc.) that operate in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth. • How to reduce the effects of interference between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices -Set the channel on your wireless network equipment to avoid the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz bandwidth which has lots of interference. -If possible, use the 5 GHz wireless network. -If the Wi-Fi router is located too far away or in environments with high interference, the network connection may be weak or unstable. -In this case, move the Wi-Fi router closer to the TV or check if there are any obstructions (e.g., concrete walls,
